# 30 days of JS challenge

Welcome to the 30 days of JavaScript challenge! Here, I will be sharing about the various concepts of JavaScript I have learned during this 30 days challenge. It includes a variety of challenges, ranging from beginner level assignments to complex projects.

## Day 01(13 July 2024) 

Today, I learned about how to declare a variable in JavaScript using `var`, `let`, and `const`, and printing the value of that variable to the console. I also learned about various data types, such as number, string, Boolean, object and array, and how to print the type of those data types using the `typeof` operator. Lastly, I learned how variable reassignment takes place when I use `let` and `const`.
